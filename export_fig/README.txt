Notes to Abbie by Abbie

1) Make sure to make the current directory where you want to save the file 
2) If you have images with squares that are not ammendable to interpolation, 
force export_fig to use the opengl rendered by adding the flag "-opengl" (but this makes it actually not an eps anymore, and it also messes with the axis line width and fonts).
